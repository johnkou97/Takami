# Scripts and notebooks for analyzing gravitational waves from Binary Neutron Star Mergers.

## Data taken from Dr. Takami's Gravitational-Waveform [Catalog](http://www.kobe-kosen.ac.jp/~takami/KTakami/contents/research/public_data/GW_Catalog/GW_Catalog_en.html) 
## Producing Fourier transformations and spectrograms of postmerger phase

### The project contains the following files:
- `Plots.ipynb`: notebook that creates the fourier tranformation plots and the spectrograms.
- `Plots.py`: script that creates the fourier tranformation plots and the spectrograms.
- `tid_def/`: folder containing all the information about the EOS of the different binary neutron stars. The analysis was done using [pyTOVpp](https://github.com/johnkou97/pyTOVpp) 
- `results/`: folder containing all the different plots that were created using the scripts and notebooks
- `old/`: folder containing old resutls
